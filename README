Navidoc - linking documentations via imagemaps
==============================================

Navidoc is a software engineering documentation tool, which turns
lexically defined UML diagrams embedded in reST into
multidirectionally hyperlinked menus connecting the design and
embedded source code documentation.

| Software name | Corresponding  |

+---------------+----------------+

Current development snapshot of Docutils in ``navidoc-depends``
is fetched 2003-04-10. The snapshot has been patched to work
better with Jython.

Getting the bleeding-edge version from CVS
------------------------------------------

You will need to check out both the ``navidoc`` 
and the ``navidoc-depends`` CVS module
from the same directory::

  cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/navidoc login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/navidoc co navidoc
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/navidoc co navidoc-depends

To update your checked out copy, run the following command both in
your ``navidoc/`` and ``navidoc-depends/`` directories::

  cvs up -dP

Setting up
==========

All settings and directories are stored in ``navidoc.conf``. Wrong
paths cause at least diagrams not to compile.

Navidoc is currently developed as part of the Fenfire project at

The mailing list is [gzz-dev]:

   http://mail.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gzz-dev/

and CVS commit messages are sent to [gzz-commits]:

   http://mail.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gzz-commits/

This is because Fenfire evolved out of an earlier project
called Gzz and we haven't fully made the move yet.

Please send bug reports as well as any comments
to [gzz-dev].

Problem Solving
===============

- Diagrams are compiled without text (and usually only connections are
  shown).

  Fonts (tfm) under navidoc/mp/ should be copied
  also to diagrams' temporary directory.

- Diagrams won't comple and no ``digramname.mp.log`` -files are
  generated into diagrams' temporary directory.
 
  All MetaPost versions won't create log files and 
  Navidoc won't work with them.

  Our MetaPost version is::

    MetaPost (Web2C 7.4.5) 0.641
    kpathsea version 3.4.5

- Got a lot of strange MetaPost errors.

  Check for possible typos in diagram elements' variable names.
  That seems to be the most usual reason.

  Check the syntax of UML directives' MetaPost part.
