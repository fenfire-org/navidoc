Tasks for navidoc
=================

0.1alpha1: First separate release    
=================================

unresolved bugs
  - bigpackage can be linked only, when it's size/location is defined explicitly

continuous:
  - more descriptive error messages from parser
  - solution for avoiding metapost errors
  - unit tests for syntax :)
  - unit test for routines

0.2alpha1:
==========

  - syntax to follow Fenfire coding standards; if it is necessary?
  - add a subtitle into javodoc/docxx output before
    diagrams from different projects?
  - NavBar update for gzz.css, to allow using NavBar with
    design documentation
  - documenting, tests
  - fix drawing of naryassoc connections
  - fix drawing of component
  - more?

Design Issues
-------------

  - plugin issues
    + nested classes in javadoc: grep for MipzipLoader.Level 
    + Currently diagrams are embedded into html-documents after
      the first header-tag. This could be enough for javadoc and
      other, but in reST this should be possible to overdrive by
      own directive.
    + unit test plugin

  - directive issues
    + diagram names should be unique, currently this can't be
      easily tested, make something for it

UML language
------------

  - fix umltool graphics to be closer to the UML 3amigos books

Docutils latex writer
---------------------

  - cleanup
  - strip all unnecessaries, if there's any
    + latex output should be as clean and readable as possible
    + should not have dependecy for unnecessary latex packages
    + collect comments and experiences of using when
      writing the article
    + summarize, what have been changed to the original latex writer

1.0: Feature-complete
=====================

anybody:
  - all UML diagrams in UML reference manual
    and user's guide should be easy to do
  - standardize on another UML tool; required features:
    + supports qualifiers, n-ary associations,
      class and sequence diagrams
    + supports arbitrary drawing on the diagrams
    + fast and easy to use and libre
  - figure out metapost tfm files; we need to have Helvetica.tfm
    since we want to use the postscript font names to get standalone
    files. But it would be nice not to have it in every directory ;)
